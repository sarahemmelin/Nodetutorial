# Node.js Tutorial Project

This project is based on the tutorial from [W3Schools Node.js Get Started](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_get_started.asp) that we were assigned in the MM207 - course at UiA.

## Description:

The project creates a basic HTTP server using Node.js. When accessed via a browser, the server responds with "Hello World!".
The terminal will also tell you that the server responded. 

## This is how you run the program:

1. Install Node.js (if not already installed):
   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Clone this repository:
   git clone <repository-URL>
   
3. Navigate to the project folder:
   Type this in the terminal:
      cd nodetutorial
   ("cd" means "change directory")

4. Start the server:
   Type this in the terminal:
      node myfirst.js

   
5. Open your browser and type: http://localhost:8080 in the adressfield.
